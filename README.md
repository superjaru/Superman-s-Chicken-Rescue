# Maximum Rescued Chickens

- This repository contains a Python script that uses the sliding window and two-pointers technique to determine the maximum number of rescued chickens with a given distance k.

# Time and Space Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of chicken positions. The script iterates through the positions array once, adjusting the window size using the two-pointers technique.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as the script uses a fixed amount of extra space for variables (res, window, left, and right) regardless of the input size.
